o Software:
Tim Hortons mobile app

o Description:
In Tim Hortons mobile app, I need to select a store and get the menu and then place the order. 
However, as a vegan it becomes really tough for me to know about the ingredients used by the shop and I end up not placing any extra order for any baked goods.
The app is not helpful at all for me to know about the ingredients used in a particular drink or dish.
This sometimes becomes bothersome and irritating.

o Solution:
On the Home page of Tim Hortons mobile app, they should provide us with a full menu along with the ingredients being listed in points format.
As a vegan, it can help me a lot while I am trying to pick out my order.
As I look up on the menu and want to have the item, it can just state that this items includes these ingredients, making it easier for me to identify the item easily.
They should include one more part in the Home page which is labelled as ingredients.
o Additional context:
This would even make it easier for other customer when they want to try new item on the list.
Providing with the list of ingrdients used in making something can also prevent people from having any allergic reaction.
