o Software: The bug was found in the software of mobile banking app of Scotiabank.

o Bug Description:
In mobile banking app of Scotiabank, while I try looking up for pending payment, the statement balance and the current balance of my credit card account, there is a different amount for every statement. The bug in this app is about how the balance of my credit card account does not gets updated after paying off the amount. Though the pending column works on time and shows the perfect balance on my credit card account, other parts do not get updated and are stuck on some of the past balances from past months.

o Steps to Reproduce: Step-by-step instructions that allow others to reproduce the bug.
- Go to the mobile banking app of Scotiabank
- Use your credit card and do not pay the pending amount for two weeks or more.
- Later open the Scotiabank mobile app and look for the credit card account in the home button.
- Open the credit account and pay for the pending amount from your Scotiabank mobile app.
- Try refreshing the credit account and the pending amount goes back to 0. However, the current balance and statement balance of the account still shows no change and shows the balance in negative amount, representing that the money is yet to be paid. This balance does not changes sometimes for days, weeks or months.
o Additional Sections:
This bug usually occurs when the pending payment is been due for more than three to five days. The system does not updates the balance of the credit account and still shows that amount is still due. As a user, this makes me really confused and sometimes scares me if this might actually alter my credit history. Since the system does not updates the current balance and statement balance, this can confuse the users and can become a bigger problem.

o Expected behavior: 
When the user is paying for the due amount on credit account, the balance within the account should be updated within a day or two so the user does not gets confused and gets anxious. If the update is going to take a longer period than usual then there should be an appropriate message displayed so the user knows that the payment was successful.
