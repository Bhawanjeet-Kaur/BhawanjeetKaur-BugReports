o Software: The bug was found in the software of Instagram app.

o Bug Description: 
In Instagram app, there sometimes appears a bug where the the notes and the list of people who are active above the messages bar suddenly disappears. This bug appears occasionally when I try switching from one account to another and the there is no option to write or read notes anymore. The entire section is not visible and even after buffering the messages, there's no response from the app.

o Steps to Reproduce: Step-by-step instructions that allow others to reproduce the
bug.
- Go to the Instagram app
- Add two accounts in the app.
- Now try switching from one account to another and keep changing it for at least five to six times.
- Open the messages section and you'll not be able to see the list of notes and list of people who are online anymore. The section where you can write a new note and read other people's notes was not visible anymore.

o Additional Sections:
When I am using more than one account, this bug usually appears occasionally on one of the accounts and makes it difficult for me as a user to read or write notes because the notes section is not visible at all and even when I try reloading the page I do not get to see it. This bug only disappears if I close the application and clear out the history from my mobile phone and reopen the app. I use IOS mobile application and this usually occurs in my mobile phone and not on the web page.

o Expected behavior:
When I am moving to and fro from two accounts, I am expecting the software to work the way it usually does and does not changes the display of things all of a sudden in the accounts.

o Smartphone :
 - Device: iPhone14
 - OS: iOS17
