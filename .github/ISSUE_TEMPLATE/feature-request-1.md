o Software:
Spotify mobile app

o Description:
In Spotify mobile app, I can make various playlists and order them however I want. Spotify did provide shuffle mode, but sometimes I want some series of songs to play one after the other but I am too lazy to create an entire playlist and arrange the songs the order I want. This takes up lot of l=time and for one time arrangement, this does not seems like a good idea.

o Solution:
Spotify should introduce a new feature on it's mobile application, queue list. While I just start playing one song and want to play another song right after the first one, I can just add up the song in the queue list and would not have to worry about looking for it after the song ends. If we can a list of songs one after the another for one time purpose, this feature would be the best one.

o Additional context:
When I play a song and look for another song, while the first song is still playing. the looked up song's option should include a new option stating to line up this song next in queue. And after the song's added in a queue, at the same place we should be able to open the queue to know which songs are being listed.
